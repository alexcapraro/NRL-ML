# NRL-ML: Predicting NRL Matches with Machine Learning

## Description

This repository is dedicated to predicting match outcomes in the National Rugby League (NRL) Premiership competition using machine learning techniques. The data used is scraped from the offical NRL website and includes both match outcomes and player-specific statistics to drive the model.

The ultimate aim is to produce a web app that hosts the predictions to learn both back- and front-end web development.
